    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hello! My name is Malik Abdullah, and I live in Lahore, Hurbanspura Road. I have a background in computer science, having completed my bachelor's degree in this field. With experience as both a Customer Service Representative and a Fleet Audit Analyst, I've developed a keen eye for detail and strong problem-solving skills.

        I have a diverse skill set, including knowledge in HTML, CSS, a bit of C++, and experience with email and chat support. Additionally, I hold a certification in cybersecurity, which has equipped me with knowledge in hacking techniques and server management.
        
        My passion lies in web development, and I'm currently on a journey to become a successful Full Stack Developer. I am particularly interested in learning the MERN stack, as I believe it aligns with my goal of becoming a proficient web developer.
        
        As a dedicated learner, I am continually exploring new technologies and frameworks to enhance my skills. My commitment to professional growth and my enthusiasm for technology drive me to keep pushing forward in my career.</p>

        <p><b><a href="./mutlipages/eip.html"> 1. Event Invitation</a></b></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The <b> Event Invitation Page Project</b> is a beginner-level HTML project that involves creating a simple web page to invite guests to an event. This page typically includes event details such as the name, date, time, and location, and often provides a form for guests to RSVP. The page may also feature a contact section with a clickable email link, which opens the user's default email client to send a pre-written email. This project helps beginners practice basic HTML structure, form creation, and using `mailto` links for email interactions.</p>
